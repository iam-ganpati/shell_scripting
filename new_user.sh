# id "$username" &>/dev/null runs the id command and redirects any output or error messages to /dev/null, effectively making the command silent.

# The &>/dev/null construct in shell scripting is used to redirect both the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) of a command to /dev/null, 
# effectively discarding any output or error messages produced by the command. This is useful when you want to suppress all output from a command.

# /dev/null is a special file on Unix-like systems that discards all data written to it.

#!/bin/bash 
username="newuser" 
 
if id "$username" &>/dev/null; then 
 echo "User $username already exists." 
else 
 useradd -m "$username" 
 echo "User $username created." 
fi
